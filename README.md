# carbohydrate-microarray-processing

An Excel macro programmed in VBA for processing carbohydrate microarray data. version v20190812, written by a chemist who is also an amateur programmer. 

This program is used for processing the carbohydrate microarray data. It takes the configuration file of the array from the Scienion array spotter to generate the layout of the array. It then processes the output file from a fluorescence scanner to perform statistical analysis. GAL file-based scanning data could also be incorporated.
