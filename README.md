# carbohydrate-microarray-processing

An Excel macro programmed in VBA for processing carbohydrate microarray data, written by a chemist who is also an amateur programmer. Most recent version is v20210615. 

This program is used for processing the carbohydrate microarray data. It takes the configuration file of the array from the array spotter along with the probe list to generate the layout of the array. It then processes the output file from an array scanner to perform statistical analysis and generate grpahs. GAL file-based scanning data could also be incorporated.
